# Project Overview


This project demonstrates video frame capture, encoding, decoding, and interactive display using WebCodecs. It is tested to work correctly in Chrome browser 39.0.7258.155 (Official Build) (arm64).

- The video stream is displayed while the screen colour toggles between white and black.
- The project chooses the highest resolution camera available for capturing video.
- 20 frames are captured from the video stream and encoded using WebCodecs.
- The encoded frames are then decoded and displayed as images in a gallery.
- Each image in the gallery can be zoomed by clicking on it.
